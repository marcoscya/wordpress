TiStore is a fresh and powerful WordPress eCommerce theme that is fully integrated with WooCommerce. The theme has a responsive design and many settings for creating a beautiful online store. With our eCommerce theme, you can customize almost every element of your site, from the top bar to the footer.

The top bar (by the way, you can hide it if you don't need the top bar), header, and footer have different layouts available. For example, if you want to display the logo at the top center, and the menu and buttons below it, then no problem, the WordPress TiStore eCommerce theme allows you to do this, such a layout is available on the settings page. Or if you need to display three sidebars/widgets in the footer, you can easily do that from the footer settings. By the way, you can display four or even five sidebars/widgets in the footer. The footer also comes with five beautiful themes (premium version) from which you can choose the one you like the most.

WordPress TiStore theme has a built-in customizable homepage, so you can show/hide different sections and give the main page of your website the design you prefer. There are different sections like Banner, WooCommerce, Sales, Benefits of Ordering, Shop by Brand, Shop by Category, Call to Action, Achievements, Advantages, Services, and Latest posts. Some of these sections are only available in the premium version of our theme. All these sections are fully customizable, so you can change the default texts/links and the entire design of these sections.

Another great feature of the WordPress TiStore theme is the many settings that are added specifically for WooCommerce pages. For example, you can change the primary button colors, text and link colors, add a search bar for your store pages, change the color of summary blocks, and more. Additionally, all these settings can be managed directly from the theme customizer page.

The theme also comes with a lot of options for the blog page. You can change the entire design of your blog page, from the layout to the post summary background and metadata colors. You can check out our themes page to learn more, or visit the demo page to see a TiStore eCommerce theme in action.
